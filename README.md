# Voxel-MAE

This is the official implementation of paper:

### Masked Autoencoders for Self-Supervised Learning on Automotive Point Clouds
The code provided here can be used to reproduce the main results of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00531).

## Usage
### Environment
**PyTorch >= 1.9 is recommended for a better support of the checkpoint technique.**
(or you can manually replace the interface of checkpoint in torch < 1.9 with the one in torch >= 1.9.)

The implementation builds upon code from [SST](https://github.com/TuSimple/SST), which in turn is based on [MMDetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d). Please refer to their [getting_started](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/blob/master/docs/en/getting_started.md) for getting the environment up and running.

### Training models
The training procedure is the same as the one in SST. Please refer to `./tools/train.py` or `./tools/dist_train.sh` for details.

### Pre-training models

In `./configs/sst_masked/`, we provide the configs used for pre-training. For instance, `sst_nuscenes_2sweeps-remove_close-cpf-scaled_masked_200e_ED8.py` is the config used for pre-training the two sweep model, and `sst_nuscenes_10sweeps-remove_close-cpf-scaled_masked_200e.py` is the config used for pre-training the ten sweep model. The config with suffix `intensity.py` use intensity information. `remove-close` refers to removal of points hitting the ego-vehicle. `cpf` refers to using the three pre-training tasks (Chamfer, #points and "fake"/empty voxels). `200e` refers to the number of epochs used for pre-training.

For pre-training on varying fractions of the dataset, use configs with suffix `fifths.py`. For instance, `sst_nuscenes_2sweeps-remove_close-cpf-scaled_masked_200e_ED8_1fifths.py` is the config used for pre-training the two sweep model on the first fifth of the dataset.

For pre-training with a subset of the pre-training tasks, use variations of `cpf`, e.g. `cf` refers to using Chamfer and fake voxels, `pf` refers to using #points and fake voxels, etc.


### Fine-tuning models

After pre-training, we can use the pre-trained checkpoints to initialize the 3D OD model. Again, training is started with `tools/train.py` or `tools/dist_train.sh`. However, to load the pre-trained weights, we need to use the `--cfg-options` option with `load_from`. For instance, `tools/dist_train.sh $CONFIG $GPUS --cfg-options load_from=$PATH_TO_PRETRAINED_CHECKPOINT`. For training models from scratch, simply disregards the `load_from`. For evaluation every 12th epoch one can use `--cfg-options evaluation.metric=nuscenes`.

Configs for fine-tuning can be found in `./configs/sst_refactor`. We use `sst_2sweeps_VS0.5_WS16_ED8_epochs288.py`  and `sst_10sweeps_VS0.5_WS16_ED8_epochs288.py` for training the two and ten sweep models. The config with suffix `intensity.py` use intensity information. `VS0.5` refers to voxel size of 0.5. `WS16` refers to window size 16. `ED8` refers to the encoder depth of 8.

Similar to pre-training configs, we provide versions for different dataset sizes, e.g. `1fiths`, `1twentieth` and `1hundreth` use 20%, 5% and 1% of the available data.
